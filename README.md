This bug demonstrates a common issue in TypeScript where the error message from the compiler isn't very descriptive when a type mismatch occurs.  Specifically, passing an array to a function expecting a string results in a cryptic error, making it difficult for beginners to understand the problem. The solution shows how to fix this by correctly typing the function parameter or modifying the function's logic to handle arrays.
